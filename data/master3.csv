Could be a rock_comma_ there are no valves or meters in the area. Can use vactor to dig up. Locates called in and Cooper Owen has the locate ticket number.Utilized mini-ex to dig approximately 3 ft deep 6 ft wide trench to locate leak. Leak was a split and repaired with a 72 length of pipe and 2 Hi-max couplings. Line was flushed and no leaks detected after repair. Pea-gravel was utilized for bedding and excavation spoils placed back on top. Customer was informed that we will return to clean up and place grass seed once dried and settled. I talked to the homeowner of 807 and he told me he has a sprinkler system but doesn’t think it comes out this close to the street and it has also been off for over a month. I also looked at their meter and there was no water moving. I checked to see if there was chlorine in the water puddle and there is and it is right over the 6” main. The leak is extremely slow because I could not see anywhere that water was pushing up or running. There is plenty of room for the vac truck but it is pretty rocky and about 15’ from an oak tree so there’s probably roots. It is between address 807 and 811 golden oaks dr.This one is done_comma_ the grass is already filling in.

We then had them shut the valve at Cr 262 and the pressure did not drop off or die out.  nnI think the valve at at Cr 262 was never opened when they installed the line.

782612,Reinstalled landscape in areas where we dug it up.  Job is complete.  We exposed service line to chase pipe that goes under the road and it was only a one inch line that went to the main.  We had to expose the service line on the other side of the road.  We uncovered the valve stack and found only a one inch valve tapped into the main.  We made another tap and pulled a new service line to the new meter.  Tested no leaks found.  We set new meter box and set it in place.  The house at 225 Standing Oak never had a meter installed during construction of the subdivision.  The meter that they tied into was the one for 221 Standing Oak.  The asbuilts show a single service for 221 on the plans.  The next phase asbuilts show that contractor was supposed to add the dual service in that phase.  The house at 232 will need a meter and tap for that lot also.  It is on the opposite side of the street.  It was missed also during construction.  He is on septic and just needs to find his water tap.We used a locator and dug up the area where it showed to be but didn’t have any success in locating the angle stop. So it might be best to dig up where the tee is to see which way the service line runs. This job will take over 15 minutes to dig with a shovelDug down with excavator to expose service line. It was one inch poly.  We quit digging because of underground utilities in the area. Called in locates at 10:00 am.

Found water running in drainage ditch.  Hand dug small hole to find water pooling and checked for residual.  Initial check was a .58 free second check after cleaning bottle was a .26 Free  Chris Graham came out and did not get much of any residual.  Went out to a second location near bye and residual was 0.   We are going to wait to Friday and let things dry out a little more before anything else is done.Myself and Adrian went back out to this area and found that the first area on Blueberry Rd. is drying up. There is no water running from that location.  The area at Blueberry and Wilson Ranch Rd. is still flowing and you can see where it is coming out of the ground above the trench line.  We checked for a residual and found NO residual. We feel it is ground water from all the rains we had.  Location past the creek on Wilson Ranch Rd. has dried up.   We then went to a fire hydrant and checked what kind of a residual there was in the line and found that it is hot _comma_ residual reacted very fast turned red immediately.  Dug where leak appeared to be according to leak detection crew there was nothing.  Found 2 pipe there is no water around pipe in that area.  Went down where water is showing up.  Found 6 elbow but can't find 2 main.  There is a lot of water coming out of the ground in this area.  We took residuals and the water was 0.01.  That is after sitting for 20 minutes.  We took one across the street at the hydrant and it turned pink instantly.  See pictures in document section.  Covered up area it is very wet.  May need to get SAMCO out to leak detect if you want to be 100 % sure.  This is at intersection of Blueberry and Wilson Ranch Road on their north side of the road.  We were going to turn valve off and see if it killed water but valve is on its side in stack and get access.  This has been called in several times and no real indication of a leak by performing leak detection in house and CL2 residual test.

We tried digging with a backhoe but the water main was laid in a rock trench so we dug to the rock shelf and then brought the Vactor out to hydro excavate the rest.

484989,I am creating a new work order to have this valve investigated to see if any work needs to be done.Valve was broken during a shutdown for contractor.  We dug it up and was able to open it back up.  Covered it up and put stack back over the valve.  The valve is located out by the hydrant on the north side of the property by the access road.  It is painted blue and marked on road 12 valve is broken.  The bad news is this is the transmission line for Rabbit Hill.  The valve is not on infor but found it on the asbuilts.  Good news is it only about 3-4 foot deep.  We need to figure out when is good time to get a new valve and parts to replace.  We may need to get with customers affected and discuss the best time to do this.  More than likely after peak demand.  We could expose piping before hand  and come in after hours and cut out and replace.  This is above my pay grade and for the people higher up to decide the best course of action.

Asked Terry Holden for an update on this on 12/11 and he will look into it. As far as he knows the line that the missing valve is on has been located again and traced out so that the contractor can find the valve. No update as of yet on when the work will take place.Email sent to Daniel Hernandez on 11/20 asking for an update on this. I will update the work order as soon as I get more information.Another update from Daniel on 8/1 stating that they still have not found the valveJust got an update from Daniel today 6/15. They have still have not found the 10 valve.Sent an email to Daniel and Terry asking for an update on locating this valve.Looked for possible closed valves. None found at the present moment but Daniel Hernandez from system engineer said he would talk to the contractors that worked on inner loop that are in charge of the Wilco project to see where our missing/buried 10” valve so we can verify that it is openNeed to do a shut down for engineers at 8 a.m.  Daniel will be on sight.Atn8am we were scheduled to turn off the 12” valve at the intersection of Hwy 29nand SE Innerloop. We isolated this valve and the 12” insta valve that wasninstalled this morning for the contractor (Jimmy Evans) to lower the water linenon HWY 29. We were not supposed to have any customers affected during thisnoutage. When the contractor cut the pipe it still had pressure and Daniel Hernandezncalled my crew out around 11:15am. We worked the insta valve several times butncould not get it to seat properly. The line was isolated around 11:45am withnthe 2 additional valves on the attached map. At 12:15pm dispatch notified usnthat the school was out of water and we had the contractor get a repair clampnso that we could restore water to the schooShut the 12” valve on the corner of inner loop and 29.

2557516,Helloupon arrival leak appeared to be a service leak because of where the bubbles were originally coming from. The leak had been leaking for a awhile because of how much water was in the area. Due to the water_comma_ rocks and roots it took hours trying to find the actual leak. The actual leak was on the 1 1/2 in cross over which had a 3in crack on the bottom of the pipe. while trying to make the repair we tried to cut the cross over off to stop water and broke the wheel valve off causing the water to shoot 20 ft in the air. we ended up stopping the other leak to replace the valve and had to shut three valves down to make repair. We replaced the 1 1/2 in valve with a 2in valve the we reduced down with bushings. once that repair was done we were able to cut and section in the 1ft of pipe. We backfilled both holes but will need a 10 ft by 10ft area of St. Augustine.
